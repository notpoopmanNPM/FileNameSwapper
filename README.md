This is what I created in Java. If you want to exchange file names, set two file paths in the text field.

Write your name on line 6, save it, and then head back to GitHub Desktop.
First,select two files that you want to swap the names with.
Second,press the label swap button.
Third,look at the capacity(KB GB) to check that it is the swap is correct to.
